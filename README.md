### Setup
* Create a folder in your local directory where you would like to begin/run this project
* cd yourfolder
* yarn create react-app my-app
* yarn add analog-clock-react
* yarn add semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css
* yarn add typeit
* yarn add react-router-dom
* Business API key is in my api.js file, which can be used for API calls (it is not my personal key, so fine to use)

### Folder Contents
* build contains code/files from npm build, when I prepared my application for deployment, does not contain much pertaining code. 
* node_modules contains all node packages when I installed npm and yarn for creating my React application. 
   * Can check node/npm/yarn version you have (if already installed) by typing node -v or npm -v or yarn -v in your terminal
* protected-falls-74694: does not contain any pertinent information, build files from Heroku deployment.
* public contains index.html, favicon.png, and other similar files that are produced when creating a React app. I did not make any changes to these files.
* src contains all the code I wrote, which will contain pertinent information. 
* package.json and yarn.lock contain information on dependencies/packages I installed for my project.

### Troubleshooting
* If you are not building this application and are viewing on Heroku:
    * If you have loading issues, try a different browser.
    * Specifically, if the page displays an "application error", try reloading the Heroku site after 1 minute, sometimes there is an outage/delay. 
    
Enjoy using my application!
